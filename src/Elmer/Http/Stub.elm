`200 OK`.

{-| Build a response stub that results in an `Http.Error`.

Suppose you want to describe the behavior that should result when a request
times out. You could create a stubbed response like so:

    Elmer.Http.Stub.for (Elmer.Http.Route.get "http://fake.com/fake")
      |> withError Http.Error.Timout

-}
withError : Http.Error -> HttpResponseStub -> HttpResponseStub
withError error =
  withResult (\_ _ ->
    Types.Error error
  )


{-| Build a response stub that returns some particular status.

Suppose you want to describe the behavior that should result when a request
returns a `500 Internal Server Error`. You could create a stubbed response like so:

    Elmer.Http.Stub.for (Elmer.Http.Route.get "http://fake.com/fake")
      |> withStatus 
          Elmer.Http.Status.serverError

-}
withStatus : HttpStatus -> HttpResponseStub -> HttpResponseStub
withStatus status =
  withResult (\_ ->
    HttpResult.withStatus status
  )


{-| Build a response stub that returns the specified string as its body.

Suppose you want to describe the behavior that results when a response body is
parsed. You could create a stub like so:

    Elmer.Http.Stub.for (Elmer.Http.Route.post "http://fake.com/fake")
      |> withBody "{\"name\":\"Fun Person\"}"

-}
withBody : String -> HttpResponseStub -> HttpResponseStub
withBody newBody =
  withResult (\_ ->
    HttpResult.withBody newBody
  )


{-| Build a response stub that has the specified header.

Add as many headers as necessary like so:

    Elmer.Http.Stub.for (Elmer.Http.Route.post "http://fake.com/fake")
      |> withBody "{\"name\":\"Fun Person\"}"
      |> withHeader ("x-fun-header", "something fun")
      |> withHeader ("x-awesome-header", "something awesome")
-}
withHeader : (String, String) -> HttpResponseStub -> HttpResponseStub
withHeader header =
  withResult (\_ ->
    HttpResult.withHeader header
  )


{-| Build a response stub that generates an HttpResult based on the matching
HttpRequest.

You could create a stub that returns a body only given a certain query string like so:

    Elmer.Http.Stub.for (
        Elmer.Http.Route.post "http://fake.com/fake"
    )
      |> withResult (\request ->
        let
          hasBowling =
            Elmer.Http.Request.queryString request
              |> String.contains "sport=bowling"
        in
          if hasBowling then
            Elmer.Http.Result.withBody
              "{\"sport\":\"bowling\"}"
          else
            Elmer.Http.Result.withStatus
              Elmer.Http.Status.notFound
      )
-}
withResult : (HttpRequest -> HttpResult -> HttpResult) -> HttpResponseStub -> HttpResponseStub
withResult builder (Types.HttpResponseStub stub) =
  let
    composedBuilder =
      (\request ->
        stub.resultBuilder request
          |> builder request
      )
  in
    Types.HttpResponseStub { stub | resultBuilder = composedBuilder }


{-| Defer a response.

The response will not be processed until `Elmer.Command.resolveDeferred` is called.

Note: If this stub is processed as part of a request made with `Http.toTask` then the
entire Task chain will be deferred until `Elmer.Command.resolveDeferred` is called.

-}
deferResponse : HttpResponseStub -> HttpResponseStub
deferResponse (Types.HttpResponseStub stub) =
  Types.HttpResponseStub { stub | deferResponse = True }
